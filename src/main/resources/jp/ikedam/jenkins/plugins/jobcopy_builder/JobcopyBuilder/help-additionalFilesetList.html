<div>
You can copy files additional to job main configuration file (config.xml).
This is useful for the case some job configurations are stored in another files (e.g. <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Promoted+Builds+Plugin">Promoted Builds Plugin</a>).
Copy operations can be also applied, but operations are designed for main configuration files, so may not work correctly for other files.
